# Image

## Collection of image manipulation programs

### Size Reduction

* There are services such as https://tinypng.com/ to reduce size of a picture. They employ technique known as "quantization" to reduce number of colors, thus reducing size of image

* size_reduction.py is based on [Color Quantization using K-Means](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_color_quantization.html)

### Color Manipulation

* Read picture as RGBA array for each pixle, then manupulate them based on condition/need.
